# HW-1-Code-Refactor

Refactor a given code for a social media webpage.

## Description
This is a Code Refactor project where we have to improve the given code by implementing the HTML and CSS technology
without changing the functionality of the website. It was a good first project as we can put our knowledge of these technologies in use and learn what the changes we can make in back end without changing the front end.


## Code Changes

- index.html is cleaned up to replace div with standard HTML tags. 
- style.css is altered by removing multiple classes with redundant functionality.
- Source code has been commented to reflect the changes.
